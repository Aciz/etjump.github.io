        <h1>Using multiple skyboxes on a map</h1>

        <p>This tutorial will touch the issue on how Q3Map2 handles multiple skyboxes in a single map. If you've ever
            created a map where you have multiple skyboxes, you have probably faced the issue we are going to fix here:
            Q3Map2 doesn't know how to use mutliple skyboxes properly, making your lightmaps overly exposured and dull
            looking.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Illustrating the issue</h2>

        <p>I created this simple map to illustrate the issue. Here we see a properly lit map, with Oasis sky.</p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/g1t86SF.jpg" alt="Properly lit map" title="" /></p>

        <p>As you can see, the shadows look nice and crisp, and there is actually difference with light and dark. Now
            what
            happens when we have 4 identical rooms, each with different skies? I copied the room 3 times, changed the
            sky
            textures so that the map has a room with Oasis, Fueldump, Goldrush and Radar skies. Here is the same room.
        </p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/iIbMeZ4.jpg" alt="Over exposured lighting" title="" /></p>

        <p>As you can see, the lighting has changed a lot: Shadows are dull, and the map in general looks too bright.
            Also,
            here are the other rooms. Notice how the lighting is exactly same in every room, despite the different
            skies.</p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/HdvmFpr.jpg" alt="Bad Fueldump" title="" /></p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/jI6gWQ9.jpg" alt="Bad Goldrush" title="" /></p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/9EvjF86.jpg" alt="Bad Radar" title="" /></p>

        <p>So what happened here?</p>

        <p>Q3Map2 cannot apply different skylight conditions in different areas in the map, even when the rooms are
            sealed
            with structural brushes and every outer surface is caulk. What it does instead is add up all skyshader
            directives that produce light into the map, and combines them to light the whole map. You could probably
            modify
            Q3Map2 to properly support multiple skyboxes as the <a
                href="https://github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant/tree/master/tools/quake3/q3map2"
                title="Q3Map2 Source Code">source
                code is available on GitHub</a>, but that's something a bit more advanced, and we are not going to do
            it.
            Instead we are going to work around this issue by modifying the sky shaders used in our map.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Fixing the shaders</h2>

        <p>First, let's take a look at the 4 sky shader we used in our map (found in fueldump.shader, skies.shader and
            skies_sd.shader).</p>

        <p>If you are unfamiliar with shaders, you might want to take a moment to look at the <a
                href="http://robotrenegade.com/q3map2/docs/shader_manual/contents.html"
                title="Q3Map2 Shader manual">Q3Map2
                Shader Manual</a> before proceeding.</p>

        <p>To fix our issues with lighting, we need to modify the shaders so that there is only <strong>one</strong> sky
            in
            our map that produces light, while the rest are just pretty looking textures. To do this, we need to figure
            out
            exactly which directives in the shaders produce light. The shader manual helps us out here. These directives
            in
            sky shaders affect the lighting in our map (not all of them are used in these shaders obviously):</p>

        <pre><code>q3map_lightimage
q3map_lightmapFilterRadius
q3map_lightRGB
q3map_lightSubdivide
q3map_noFast
q3map_skylight
q3map_sun
q3map_sunExt
q3map_surfacelight</code></pre>

        <p>In general we don't need to worry that much about most of these, as they just modify the lighting instead of
            producing it. The most commonly seen directives that actually produce light are <code>q3map_skylight</code>,
            <code>q3map_sun</code>,
            <code>q3map_sunExt</code> and <code>q3map_surfacelight</code> in conjunction with
            <code>q3map_lightSubdivide</code>. To understand what these do, read
            the descriptions of them in the shader manual.
        </p>

        <p>Now that we know which directives we need to modify, it's time to start editing the shaders. First, we create
            a
            shader file that includes the skies used in our map. Next, we change the paths of the shaders so that we
            don't
            mess up the original sky shaders in the game. So for example, I renamed the shaders as following:</p>

        <pre><code>textures/skytut/fueldump
textures/skytut/goldrush
textures/skytut/radar
textures/skytut/oasis</code></pre>


        <p>Now we need to comment out every light producing directive in every shader except for one, which is going to
            be
            the only shader that produces light in the map. Another option is to change the intensity values of the
            light-producing shaders to 0.
            I chose Fueldump sky shader to produce light into the map, and commented out every light producing directive
            in
            the rest of the shaders. Now, in the map with 4 identical rooms each with different sky shader, here is the
            room with Oasis sky.</p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/C69Lp6v.jpg" alt="New lighting in Oasis" title="" /></p>

        <p>And a picture showing the lighting in every room.</p>

        <p><img src="images/using-multiple-skyboxes-on-a-map/026CqU3.jpg" alt="New lighting in all rooms" title="" />
        </p>

        <p>Now the rooms are all lit by the Fueldump sky, and we have proper difference between shadow and light again.
            The
            lighting is exactly same in every room, but they are not overly bright. As mentioned earlier, it is not
            possible
            to have different sky lighting conditions in different parts of the map, but with this method it's possible
            to
            use multiple skyboxes while still maintaining crisp shadows and keeping the brightness level of the map
            natural.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Design notes</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>You might want to further modify the light producing directives to find lighting conditions that look
                good
                on every sky. I recommend reading the article about <a
                    href="http://robotrenegade.com/q3map2/docs/shader_manual/light-emitting-shaders.html"
                    title="Q3Map2: Light Emitting Shaders">light emitting shaders</a> in the shader manual.
            </li>
            <li>Sunshaders should be commented out as well, since they are global for the whole map so they appear even
                on
                skies that have no sunshader directive.
            </li>
            <li>Light produced by <code>q3map_sun</code> and <code>q3map_sunExt</code> falls off with angle, but not
                distance.</li>
            <li>In general, it's recommended to use a combination of <code>q3map_sunExt</code>,
                <code>q3map_lightmapFilterRadius</code> and
                <code>q3map_skylight</code> to produce light on sky shader. Refer to the light emitting shaders article
                on shader manual
                mentioned earlier.
            </li>
        </ul>
